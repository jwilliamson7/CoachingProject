Predicting the Average Two-Year Win Probability and Hire Tenure of NFL Head Coach Hires

1. Introduction

What if the Denver Broncos could have avoided hiring Nathaniel Hackett? Or if the Raiders had not hired Josh McDaniels? Certainly, these teams would be in a different position today if they had hired different candidates. But more broadly, what if NFL teams could predict which head coach candidates would be successful? That is the aim of this project. Specifically, this project attempts to predict two outcomes of head coach hires: (1) the average two-year winning probability, and (2) the hire tenure, using statistics available at the time the hire was made. This project also provides predictions of these metrics for recently hired coaches.
2. Literature Review

At the time of writing, there have been no journal publications that attempt to predict the success of NFL coaching hires through statistical learning techniques. Currently, the NFL is only just beginning to implement artificial intelligence (AI) in play calling prediction [1]. There are few papers that examine the impact of individual features on NFL head coaching success. Reference [2] used a linear regression with seven features to attempt to predict the number of wins of head coaches in their first three years to understand if prior NFL head coaching experience impacts success in position. This paper found that a previous head coaching experience had a negative impact on the success of new head coaches. Despite this finding, the model supported an adjusted R^2 of only 0.336. This low value, the lack of regularization, and the small number of features decreases confidence in the study's findings. Reference [3] reviews research in sports economics and suggests that hiring decisions made solely on playing success are unlikely to be optimal given financial (resource) inequality among sports franchises.

3. Methods

Using statistics available at the time of hiring, this project attempts to predict two outcomes of head coach hires: (1) the average two-year winning probability, and (2) the hire tenure, using XGBoost models [4]. This project uses root-mean-squared error and macro-averaged one-versus-rest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to measure model performance for the regressors and classifiers, respectively. Raw data was collected by scraping pro-football-reference.com.
3.1. Predicting Coach Tenure Classification
The tenure of a coach hire is defined as the number of years the hired coach remains in the same position before being fired, leaving for another role, or retiring. Equation (1) shows the mapping between the coach tenure, t (in years), and the three coach tenure classification labels, C(t). This project groups coach tenures into classes for classification rather than predicting the number of years with a regression as there is little apparent difference between coaches with similar tenures. For example, a coach that remains in position for 15 years is not 50% more successful than a coach who remains in position for 10 years. These different coach classifications are intended to indicate different levels of coaching success based on the number of years they maintain their position.
C(t)={?(0@1@2)?    ?(t?2@2<t?4@t>4)(1)This model seeks to predict the coaching tenure classification of head coach hires based on statistics available at the time of hiring. While this project did implement different types of predictive models, only the most successful model (XGBoost) will be discussed in this paper. 
This project utilizes extensive cross-validation to determine hyperparameter values for each implementation. This project uses macro-averaged one-versus-rest (OVR) area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) to measure model performance. This performance metric accounts for class imbalance.
3.2. Predicting Average Two-Year Winning Probability
Equation (2) defines the calculation of average winning probability, p_win, as a function of the number of wins, n_wins, the number of losses, n_losses, and the number of ties, n_ties, of a head coach over any interval.
p_win=(n_wins+0.5*n_ties)/(n_wins+n_losses+n_ties )(2)This winning probability is bound within [0, 1]. This project implements XGBoost Regressor to attempt this prediction [4]. This regressor uses gradient boosting to build a single predication model through the aggregation of weak learners. This project uses trees as the universal model for the XGBoost weak learners. This project utilizes extensive cross-validation to determine the optimal values for hyperparameters for each model implementation. 
This project uses root mean squared error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric for these regression models. This metric was chosen for two reasons. Firstly, its dimensions are identical to the dimensions of the prediction variable. Secondly, it punishes outliers greater than absolute error. It is important to note that the thresholds that constitute “good” and “bad” RMSE are impacted by the scale of the prediction. As a result, this project compares model RMSE against the RMSE for predicting the expected outcome to understand model performance.
3.3. Data Description
This project utilizes 150 features, two description labels, and the two model outputs for each head coaching hire. Appendix A shows the set of 150 features used. Abbreviations included in feature descriptions include offensive coordinator (OC), defensive coordinator (DC), and head coach (HC). Features 1-140 are characteristics of head coaches at time of hiring, while features 141-150 are characteristics of the hiring team. Features 9-140 and 141-150 reference average normalized metrics, utilizing a traditional z-score distance from league average. This normalization allows coaches across eras to be compared, as team performance is measured relative to other teams in the same year. This project utilizes SVD Matrix Imputation to impute missing values. Figure 1 shows the correlation matrix among all 150 features post imputation. There is some correlation within the sections of features associated with experience as an OC, DC, or HC. Appendix B shows the distribution of two-year win probabilities and the distribution of coach tenure classifications across all hiring instances in the history of the NFL.

4. Results

For all models and all implementations, the data was split into training and validation sets via an 80/20 ratio. Each model was created using multiple levels of internal cross-validation in order to tune hyperparameters (final hyperparameter values are shown in Appendix C). This section reports performance metrics on the training set, the validation set, and the testing set. The validation set is the set of data set aside within internal cross-validation during hyperparameter tuning. The testing set is 20% of the entire data set that was not used in any portion of training. Final claims of model performance are made on performance with the testing set using a single model with tuned hyperparameters.
4.1. Predicting Coach Tenure Classification

4.1.1. XGBoost Classifier Model Performance
Table 1 shows the macro-averaged one-versus-rest (OVR) area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and F1 values for the XGBoost implementation across the train, validation, and test sets. 
Table 1. Coach tenure classification prediction result comparison

The XGBoost classifier had an OVR AUROC value of 0.841, indicating that the model has strong predictive utility. Moreover, the model shows a ~4.5x improvement in F1 score (0.584 vs. 0.130) versus human decisions, if one assumes that all head coach hires were expected to be class 2 by the hiring team. Fig. 2 shows the sorted validation set with corresponding marks for the ground truth values and the predicted values. 

Figure 2. Validation set, XGBoost classifier prediction versus ground truth
Fig. 3 shows the feature weight distributions resulting from the best models found within the outer ten-fold cross-validation. These importance values for these features do not infer a monotonic relationship between feature value and predicted value. Rather, these importance values result from feature prevalence in the model's weak estimators. A feature with higher importance is present in more estimators than a feature with low importance. 

Figure 3. XGBoost classifier feature importance distributions
The features with the highest average importance are shown below in Table 2. 10 of the top 20 most important features are attributes of the coach’s team during a previous head coaching role—suggesting that past performance is a predictor of future performance. One notable finding is that the number of years as an NFL coordinator is significantly less important than the number of years of experience as an NFL position coach. Additionally, three of the top 20 features are attributes of the coach’s team during their role as a defensive coordinator, but none of the top 20 features are attributes of the coach’s team during their role as an offensive coordinator.

4.1.2. Predicting the tenure of recent head coach hires
Table 3 below shows the final model's predictions for coach tenure for the 21 head coaches hired in the last four years. This table also shows the probabilities associated with each class prediction; these probabilities sum to 1, and the class with the greatest probability is the final predicted class. As a reminder, Class 0 represents coaches who remain a head coach for 1-2 years, Class 1 represents coaches who remain a head coach for 3-4 years, and class 2 represents coaches who remain a head coach for 5+ years.

Many of these predictions seem to track with the coaches’ trajectories. The clearest example is Josh McDaniels (Las Vegas Raiders), who was fired last week at the time of this writing, ending his tenure at less than 2 years (Class 0). The model predicted Class 0 for Josh McDaniels. The model predicted 3 of the hires to be Class 2: DeMeco Ryans (Houston Texans), Kevin O’Connell (Minnesota Vikings), and Matt Eberflus (Chicago Bears). Although Eberflus seems to be trending towards being fired this year, DeMeco Ryans and Kevin O’Connell have both had strong starts to their careers. Also note that Miami Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel was within one percentage point of also being categorized as Class 2.

4.2.1. XGBoost Regressor Model Performance
Table 4 shows the RMSE values for the three implementations across the train, test, and validation sets.

This table shows that the XGBoost regressor had the best performance on the validation set. However, all models showed poor RMSE performance when compared to predicting the expected value. These findings suggest that these features, largely driven by characteristics of the head coach, are not sufficient to predict a team's winning probability. In other words, it appears that a head coach hire will not determine win probability based on these features.
This subsection provides an overview of the best regression model. For details on the other models and the predictions made by this model, see Appendix D. The XGBoost regressor had a RMSE value of 0.192, indicating that the model has poor predictive utility. This finding in itself is noteworthy, as it suggests that characteristics of a head coach are not sufficient to predict a team’s winning probability. The feature weight distributions shown in Figure 4 also support this claim.

Figure 4. XGBoost regressor feature importance distributions
The features with the highest average importance are shown below in Table 5. Of the top 20 features, 8 are attributes of the hiring team. Additionally, the most important predictor of a head coach’s two-year winning percentage is the previous two-year winning percentage of the hiring team. This feature is more than 20% more important than the 2nd ranked feature. These findings suggest that the hiring team itself, not the head coach, drive win probability. Equivalently, the features of the coach themselves, including whether or not they have been a successful coordinator in the past, are not sufficient to predict two-year winning percentage.

4.2.2. Predicting the two-year win probability of recent head coach hires
Table 6 below shows the model’s prediction for average two-year win probability for the 13 head coaches hired in the NFL in the past two offseasons (2022 and 2023 hiring cycles) who are still with their team (including Josh McDaniels, Las Vegas Raiders).

As shown in Appendix D, the model tends to predict winning probabilities near the average. This set of coaches is no exception to this tendency.
5. Conclusion

The coach tenure classification models showed significantly better performance than predicting the most prevalent class. These results suggest that the features in this project have some ability to predict the tenure of head coach hires. This finding poses immense potential value for NFL teams, as enabling the hiring of a differentiated NFL head coach could bring about lasting success and divisional dominance, subsequently increasing the historical importance of a franchise and improving its bottom line.
The three winning probability prediction models showed poor performance when compared to predicting the expected value. The best RMSE value was 0.192, equivalent to predicting the number of won games in a 17-game season to within 3.26 wins. These findings suggest that the features in this project, largely driven by characteristics of the head coach, are not sufficient to predict a team's winning probability. In essence, this research underscores that, for NFL teams aiming to enhance their winning potential, the team’s focus must extend beyond a coach's past track record and into other factors, such as team dynamics, personnel, and strategic coordination.
