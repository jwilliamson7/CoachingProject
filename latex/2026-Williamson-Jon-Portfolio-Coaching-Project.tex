\section{Introduction}

What if the Denver Broncos could have avoided hiring Nathaniel Hackett? Or if the Raiders had not hired Josh McDaniels? Certainly, these teams would be in a different position today if they had hired different candidates. But more broadly, what if NFL teams could predict which head coach candidates would be successful? That is the aim of this project.

The stakes of head coaching decisions are substantial. NFL teams invest significant resources in coaching searches, and a failed hire carries consequences beyond the win-loss record: organizational instability, wasted draft capital on players who don't fit the new system, and the opportunity cost of not hiring a more successful candidate. Since 2000, approximately half of all NFL head coaching hires have lasted two years or fewer, suggesting that teams systematically struggle to identify candidates who will succeed in the role. Yet despite this high failure rate, the hiring process remains largely subjective, driven by interviews, references, and gut instinct rather than data-driven analysis.

Tenure serves as a more robust measure of coaching success than win-loss percentage because it implicitly accounts for organizational context and expectations. A coach who maintains a .450 winning percentage with a rebuilding franchise may be considered successful and retain their position, while a coach with the same record on a team expected to contend may be fired after two seasons. Tenure captures this reality: it reflects not just on-field performance but also the organization's assessment of whether the coach is meeting expectations given the circumstances. By predicting tenure rather than wins, the model learns patterns that generalize across different team situations without requiring explicit modeling of each organization's unique context.

This project addresses this gap by developing a machine learning model to predict head coach tenure classification using only information available at the time of hiring. By analyzing 150 engineered features spanning coach experience, historical team performance during prior coordinator and head coaching roles, and hiring team context, the model provides an objective, data-driven assessment of coaching candidates. The ordinal classification approach respects the natural ordering of tenure outcomes, distinguishing between short (1--2 years), medium (3--4 years), and long (5+ years) tenures, while penalizing distant misclassifications more heavily than adjacent errors.

\section{Literature Review}

At the time of writing, there have been no journal publications that attempt to predict the success of NFL coaching hires through statistical learning techniques. Currently, the NFL is only just beginning to implement artificial intelligence (AI) in play calling prediction \citep{datarobot2020}.

There are few papers that examine the impact of individual features on NFL head coaching success. \citet{roach2016} used a linear regression with seven features to attempt to predict the number of wins of head coaches in their first three years to understand if prior NFL head coaching experience impacts success in position. This paper found that previous head coaching experience had a negative impact on the success of new head coaches. Despite this finding, the model supported an adjusted $R^2$ of only 0.336. This low value, the lack of regularization, and the small number of features decreases confidence in the study's findings.

\citet{mielke2007} reviews research in sports economics and suggests that hiring decisions made solely on playing success are unlikely to be optimal given financial (resource) inequality among sports franchises.

\section{Methods}

Using statistics available at the time of hiring, this project attempts to predict the tenure classification of NFL head coach hires using XGBoost models \citep{chen2016}. Raw data was collected by scraping pro-football-reference.com. All data processing, model implementation, and analysis were performed using Python with scikit-learn \citep{pedregosa2011}.

\subsection{Predicting Coach Tenure Classification}

The tenure of a coach hire is defined as the number of years the hired coach remains in the same position before being fired, leaving for another role, or retiring. Equation~\eqref{eq:tenure_class} shows the mapping between the coach tenure $t$ (in years) and the three coach tenure classification labels $C(t)$.

\begin{equation}
C(t) = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } t \leq 2 \\
1 & \text{if } 2 < t \leq 4 \\
2 & \text{if } t > 4
\end{cases}
\label{eq:tenure_class}
\end{equation}

This project groups coach tenures into classes for classification rather than predicting the number of years with a regression as there is little apparent difference between coaches with similar tenures. For example, a coach that remains in position for 15 years is not 50\% more successful than a coach who remains in position for 10 years. These different coach classifications are intended to indicate different levels of coaching success based on the number of years they maintain their position.

Importantly, these tenure classes exhibit a natural ordering (Class 0 $<$ Class 1 $<$ Class 2), making ordinal classification more appropriate than standard multiclass methods. Standard multiclass approaches treat all misclassifications equally, but in this domain, predicting Class 0 for a true Class 2 coach is a more severe error than predicting Class 1.

\subsubsection{Frank-Hall Ordinal Classification}

This project implements ordinal classification using the Frank-Hall binary decomposition method \citep{frank2001}. For $K$ ordinal classes, this approach trains $K-1$ binary classifiers, each predicting the probability that an instance exceeds a given threshold. For our 3-class problem:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Classifier 1}: $P(Y > 0)$ --- distinguishes Class 0 from Classes 1 and 2
    \item \textbf{Classifier 2}: $P(Y > 1)$ --- distinguishes Classes 0 and 1 from Class 2
\end{itemize}

Class probabilities are then derived from these cumulative probabilities:
\begin{align}
P(Y = 0) &= 1 - P(Y > 0) \\
P(Y = 1) &= P(Y > 0) - P(Y > 1) \\
P(Y = 2) &= P(Y > 1)
\end{align}

The Frank-Hall method offers several advantages: it works with any base classifier (preserving XGBoost's strengths), produces interpretable probability distributions, and naturally penalizes distant misclassifications.

\subsubsection{Evaluation Metrics}

This project uses Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) as the primary evaluation metric because it is specifically designed for ordinal classification problems. QWK measures agreement between predicted and true classes while weighting disagreements by their squared distance; a prediction of Class 0 for a true Class 2 instance is penalized four times more heavily than a prediction of Class 1. This property aligns with the practical reality that predicting a short tenure for a coach who achieves long tenure (or vice versa) represents a more consequential error than being off by one class. QWK also served as the optimization target during hyperparameter tuning, ensuring that the model explicitly learns to minimize ordinal prediction errors. Secondary metrics include mean absolute error (average class distance between predictions and truth), adjacent accuracy (proportion of predictions within one class), and macro F1 score (for comparison with standard classification approaches).

\subsubsection{Cross-Validation Strategy}

To prevent data leakage, this project implements coach-level stratified cross-validation. Since individual coaches may appear multiple times in the dataset (e.g., Bill Belichick was hired as head coach in both 1991 and 2000), all instances for a given coach are kept together in either the training or test set. This ensures the model cannot learn from a coach's prior hiring outcomes when predicting their tenure in a different role.

\subsection{Data Description}

This project utilizes 150 engineered features for each head coaching hire, organized into five categories as shown in Table~\ref{tab:feature_categories}. Appendix~\ref{app:features} provides the complete list of features.

\begin{table}[!ht]
\caption{Feature categories and counts}
\label{tab:feature_categories}
\small
\begin{tabular}{llcl}
\toprule
Category & Features & Count & Description \\
\midrule
Core Experience & 1--8 & 8 & Age, prior HC hires, years at each coaching level \\
OC Statistics & 9--41 & 33 & Team offensive performance during OC tenure \\
DC Statistics & 42--74 & 33 & Opponent offensive performance during DC tenure \\
HC Statistics & 75--107 & 33 & Team offensive performance during HC tenure \\
HC Opponent Stats & 108--140 & 33 & Opponent offensive performance during HC tenure \\
Hiring Team Context & 141--150 & 10 & Hiring team's recent performance metrics \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Core Experience Features (8 features)} capture fundamental coaching background: age at time of hire, number of previous head coaching stints, and years of experience at each level (college position coach, college coordinator, college head coach, NFL position coach, NFL coordinator, and NFL head coach).

\textbf{Coordinator and Head Coach Statistics (132 features)} capture team performance during the coach's prior roles. For each role (OC, DC, HC), 33 statistics are recorded spanning offensive production (points, yards, turnovers), passing efficiency (completions, yards, touchdowns, interceptions, net yards per attempt), rushing performance (attempts, yards, touchdowns), drive metrics (scoring percentage, turnover percentage, plays per drive, yards per drive), and situational effectiveness (third-down conversion rate, fourth-down conversion rate, red zone percentage). For defensive coordinators, these statistics reflect opponent performance (i.e., points allowed, yards allowed). For head coaches, both team and opponent statistics are captured, resulting in 66 features.

\textbf{Hiring Team Context (10 features)} capture the state of the team at the time of hiring: winning percentage, points scored, points allowed, yards of offense, yards allowed, yards per play, yards per play allowed, turnovers forced, turnovers committed, and playoff appearances; averaged over the two seasons prior to the hire.

All performance statistics (features 9--150) are normalized using z-scores relative to league averages for each season, enabling meaningful comparisons across eras. For example, a coach whose offense ranked one standard deviation above league average in 1985 is comparable to a coach whose offense ranked one standard deviation above average in 2020.

This project utilizes SVD-based matrix factorization to impute missing values, which occur when coaches lack experience at certain levels (e.g., a first-time head coach has no prior HC statistics). Figure~\ref{fig:correlation} shows the correlation matrix among all 150 features post-imputation. Notable correlation exists within feature categories, particularly among offensive statistics during OC tenure and among statistics during HC tenure, reflecting the interdependence of team performance metrics. Appendix~\ref{app:distributions} shows the distribution of coach tenure classifications across all hiring instances.

\label{fig:correlation}
\end{figure}

\section{Results}

The dataset contains 635 coaching hire instances with known tenure outcomes, featuring 150 engineered features per instance. The class distribution is imbalanced: Class 0 (1--2 years) comprises 49.0\% of instances, Class 1 (3--4 years) comprises 26.8\%, and Class 2 (5+ years) comprises 24.3\%.

Data was split into training (508 instances) and test (127 instances) sets using coach-level stratified sampling to prevent data leakage. Hyperparameters were tuned via 5-fold coach-level cross-validation on the training set (final values shown in Appendix~\ref{app:hyperparameters}). All reported metrics are evaluated on the held-out test set.

\subsection{Predicting Coach Tenure Classification}

\subsubsection{Ordinal Classification Model Performance}

Table~\ref{tab:tenure_results} shows the performance metrics for the ordinal XGBoost classifier on the held-out test set (127 instances). The model achieves strong performance across all ordinal metrics.

\begin{table}[!ht]
\caption{Coach tenure classification prediction results (Ordinal Model)}
\label{tab:tenure_results}
\small
\begin{tabular}{lc}
\toprule
Metric & Test Set Performance \\
\midrule
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) & 0.307 \\
Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) & 0.754 \\
Adjacent Accuracy ($\pm$1 class) & 98.4\% \\
Exact Accuracy & 72.4\% \\
Macro F1 Score & 0.695 \\
AUROC (macro OVR) & 0.881 \\
\midrule
Human Baseline F1$^1$ & 0.130 \\
\midrule
Model Improvement$^2$ & 5.3$\times$ \\
\bottomrule
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\footnotesize $^1$Assuming all GMs believe their selected HC is Class 2} \\
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\footnotesize $^2$Model F1 vs. human baseline} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The ordinal model achieves a quadratic weighted kappa of 0.754, indicating substantial agreement between predictions and true labels while accounting for ordinal distance. The model achieves 98.4\% adjacent accuracy, meaning nearly all predictions are within one class of the true label, which is a critical property for ordinal classification.

\subsubsection{Comparison with Standard Multiclass Classification}

To validate the ordinal approach, we compare against a standard multiclass XGBoost classifier trained with the same hyperparameters. Table~\ref{tab:model_comparison} shows that the ordinal model outperforms multiclass on most metrics, particularly those that account for class ordering.

\begin{table}[!ht]
\caption{Ordinal vs.\ Multiclass model comparison on held-out test set}
\label{tab:model_comparison}
\small
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
Metric & Ordinal & Multiclass & Better \\
\midrule
MAE & \textbf{0.307} & 0.402 & Ordinal \\
QWK & \textbf{0.754} & 0.672 & Ordinal \\
Adjacent Accuracy & \textbf{98.4\%} & 96.9\% & Ordinal \\
Exact Accuracy & \textbf{72.4\%} & 63.0\% & Ordinal \\
Macro F1 & \textbf{0.695} & 0.589 & Ordinal \\
AUROC & \textbf{0.881} & 0.836 & Ordinal \\
Class 1 F1 & \textbf{0.581} & 0.358 & Ordinal (+62.3\%) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The ordinal model shows consistent improvement across all metrics, with the most notable improvement in Class 1 (middle class) F1 score. The middle class is typically most difficult to predict because it can be confused with both Class 0 and Class 2; the ordinal model's 62.3\% improvement (0.581 vs.\ 0.358) demonstrates that the Frank-Hall decomposition, combined with QWK-based hyperparameter optimization, substantially helps distinguish the intermediate tenure class.

Figure~\ref{fig:tenure_predictions} shows the sorted validation set with corresponding marks for the ground truth values and the predicted values.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.98\textwidth]{figures/tenure_predictions.png}
\caption{Ordinal model predictions versus ground truth on the held-out test set. Top row shows true class; bottom row shows predicted class. Hatched bars indicate misclassifications. Instances are sorted by true class, then by predicted class within each true class.}
\label{fig:tenure_predictions}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:category_importance} shows the total and average feature importance aggregated by category.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{figures/category_importance_total.png}
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{figures/category_importance_avg.png}
\caption{Feature importance aggregated by category. Left: Total importance (sum across all features in category). Right: Average importance (mean per feature). HC Stats contribute highest total importance due to the large number of features, while average importance per feature is similar across categories.}
\label{fig:category_importance}
\end{figure}

The HC Stats category (66 features) contributes the highest total importance (0.459), reflecting the large number of features capturing prior head coaching performance. This aligns with intuition: coaches who have previously succeeded as head coaches carry demonstrated evidence of their capabilities. DC Stats (0.256) and OC Stats (0.166) contribute less total importance, while Core Experience (0.064) and Hiring Team (0.056) contribute the least due to their smaller feature counts.

When examining average importance per feature, a Kruskal-Wallis test reveals no statistically significant differences across categories ($H = 2.42$, $p = 0.66$). The mean importance values are similar: Core Experience (0.0080), DC Stats (0.0078), HC Stats (0.0069), Hiring Team (0.0056), and OC Stats (0.0050). This finding suggests that the model draws broadly on information from all feature categories rather than relying heavily on any single type of predictor. The predictive signal for tenure classification is distributed across coaching experience, prior performance at multiple levels, and team context.

\subsubsection{Predicting the Tenure of Recent Head Coach Hires}

Table~\ref{tab:tenure_predictions} shows the ordinal model's predictions for coach tenure for the 21 head coaches hired in the last four years. This table also shows the probabilities associated with each class prediction; these probabilities sum to 1, and the class with the greatest probability is the final predicted class. As a reminder, Class 0 represents coaches who remain a head coach for 1--2 years, Class 1 represents coaches who remain a head coach for 3--4 years, and Class 2 represents coaches who remain a head coach for 5+ years.

Seven coaches in the prediction set (marked with *) have prior head coaching stints that appear in the training data. To prevent data leakage, these coaches are predicted using a model retrained with their prior instances excluded. This ensures predictions are based solely on their characteristics at time of hire, not on the model having seen their past outcomes.

\begin{table}[!ht]

\end{table}

After applying the data leakage fix, the ordinal model predicts only 1 of the 21 recent hires to achieve Class 2 (5+ years): Mike Vrabel (58.7\% confidence). Notably, Pete Carroll, who would have been predicted Class 2 without the leakage fix due to the model having learned from his successful 14-year Seattle tenure, is instead predicted Class 1 (64.3\%) when his prior outcomes are excluded from training. This demonstrates the importance of preventing data leakage for fair predictions. The model shows highest confidence (95.7\%) that Raheem Morris will have a short tenure, while DeMeco Ryans and Dan Quinn receive strong Class 1 predictions (93.6\% and 91.4\%, respectively), suggesting moderate expected tenure with high confidence.

\section{Conclusion}

The ordinal classification approach using the Frank-Hall binary decomposition method, optimized with Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK), demonstrates strong predictive performance for NFL head coach tenure. The model achieves a QWK of 0.754, AUROC of 0.881, and 98.4\% adjacent accuracy on held-out test data, indicating that predictions are both accurate and, when incorrect, typically only off by one class. Compared to a standard multiclass approach, the ordinal model shows improvements across all metrics, with a notable 62.3\% improvement in the challenging middle-class (3--4 year tenure) F1 score (0.581 vs.\ 0.358).

Feature importance analysis at the category level reveals that HC Stats (capturing prior head coaching performance) contributes the highest total importance due to its large feature count, while average importance per feature shows no statistically significant differences across categories ($p = 0.66$). This suggests the model draws broadly on information from all feature types, rather than relying heavily on any single category of predictors.

The practical implications of this research extend beyond academic interest. With approximately half of NFL head coaching hires lasting two years or fewer, teams clearly struggle to identify successful candidates through traditional evaluation methods. The model's 5.3$\times$ improvement over the human baseline (Macro F1 of 0.695 vs.\ 0.130) demonstrates that data-driven approaches can substantially outperform intuition-based hiring decisions. While no model can guarantee successful hires, integrating predictive analytics into the evaluation process could help teams avoid high-risk candidates and identify undervalued coaching talent. For a league where a single additional win can mean the difference between playoff contention and a losing season, even modest improvements in hiring decisions translate to meaningful competitive advantages. The model's predictions for recent hires, such as high confidence that Mike Vrabel will achieve long tenure and that Raheem Morris faces a short tenure, illustrate how these insights can inform real-world evaluations and set appropriate expectations for coaching transitions.
